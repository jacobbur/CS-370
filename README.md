**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
For this assignment, a large portion of code was provided for me. That code is the agent itself and the game. The work that I provided to the project consisted of the main loop. By this, I mean the cycle that the agent takes to successfully navigate the maze (exploitation vs. exploration). 

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists design, develop, and utilize hardware and software to assist in the development and practices of areas such as science, business, and life. With the current age of technological advancement, computer scientists are essential for the development and maintenance of systems to aid in all aspects of life. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
When I approach a problem, the first thing I do is identify that problem to ensure that I know exactly what the issue is. After I had done that, I read through the code to see where the issue might be stemming from. Next, I make note of potential solutions to the problem. Lastly, I test those potential solutions until I find one that works without damaging the integrity of the system. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
As a software developer, I have the ethical responsibility to deliver work that is to the best of my ability while also ensuring that user safety is at the forefront of my work. User safety and security should never fall to the side just to ensure timelines are met or budgets are maintained.
